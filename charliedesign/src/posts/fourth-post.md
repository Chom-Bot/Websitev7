this is how i built my website and the evoloution of how it came to be 

**We started off by building it in wordpress...**
*but it was to basic for our needs*

So we decided to go for NextJS, Which was good but was overly complicated for just a portfolio website

After a long break from development of the website, i decided to switch it to sveltekit, which was a way simpler and more efficent way of building the website.

This is what it is currently built on and works very well
